## For instructions on how to use MiSTGUI.py, refer to the pdf in this repository:
GUI_Mass_Spectrometry_interaction_STatistics_(MiST).pdf

## To use without the GUI, go to the noGUI directory, update the input file to be your Spectronaut .tsv, then run the Python script
Spectronaut output should have the following columns to be compatible with this script: 
R.FileName, PG.MolecularWeight, PG.ProteinAccessions, PG.AvLog2Quantity, and PEP.MS1Quantity
